# Setting Up Next.js Application Locally

This guide will walk you through setting up a Next.js application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-nextjs-app.git
cd your-nextjs-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Next.js projects use either npm or yarn to manage dependencies. Run one of the following commands based on your package manager preference:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

#### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Start the development server to run the Next.js app locally:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Once the server is running, you can open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

### 4. Building for Production

If you want to build the application for production, run the following command:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will generate an optimized build of your application.

### 5. Start the Production Server

To start the production server after building the application:

#### Using npm:

```bash
npm start
```

#### Using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```
